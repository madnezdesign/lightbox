madPix Lightbox Jquery
For everything to function correctly you will also need to download JQuery.

In order for the lightbox to work you have to include the plugin:

$(document).ready(function(){
'use strict';
$('.madImg').madPix();
});

add the plugin in a seperate .js file and include that .js file in the template of your choosing, for example, 
in the index.html or in the footer of the index.php
